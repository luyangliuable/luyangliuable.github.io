                <h1>Melbourne Housing Landscape: House Prices, Rental Cisis and Property Type</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to 'The Anatomy of <b>Melbourneâ€™s Housing Market</b>: From <b>Housing Crisis</b> to <b>Home Ownership</b>.' This visualization explores the contrasting realities of Melbourne's housing landscape.<br /><br />
                    From skyrocketing house and rent prices in various suburbs to the city's homelessness crisis, we delve into multiple facets of the market. Aimed at policymakers, real estate professionals, and residents, our data offers a comprehensive look at Melbourne's complex housing ecosystem

                        In our data visualization, the average house price has been calculated through a process of normalization to provide a more nuanced perspective. Specifically, we took the total house price for each property and divided it by the number of rooms, thus generating a <i><b>'Price Per Room'</b></i> metric.
                        <br /> 
                        <br /> 
                        The equation used for this is:
                        <br /> 
                            \( \text{Average Price Per Room} = \frac{\text{Sum of (House Price/Number of Rooms)}}{\text{Total Number of Properties}} \)
                        <br /> 
                        After obtaining this normalized value for each property, we then computed the average across all properties in various suburbs. This method allows for a more equitable comparison across Melbourne's diverse housing market.

                        In Melbourne, the rental market is as dynamic as it is challenging for tenants. Known for its vibrant culture and booming job market, the city has seen a steady increase in rent prices over recent years.

                        While some suburbs offer relatively affordable options, prime locations in the city centre and coastal areas often come with exorbitant rental costs. In our data visualization, we've included a comprehensive breakdown of average rent prices by suburb to provide a clearer picture of what you can expect to pay. These figures reveal a pressing need for policy intervention to address housing affordability, especially as many residents already allocate a significant portion of their income towards rent.
