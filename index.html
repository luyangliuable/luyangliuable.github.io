                        <h1>Normalised House Prices in Melbourne</h1>
                        In our data visualization, the average house price has been calculated through a process of normalization to provide a more nuanced perspective. Specifically, we took the total house price for each property and divided it by the number of rooms, thus generating a <i><b>'Price Per Room'</b></i> metric.
                        <br /> 
                        <br /> 
                        The equation used for this is:
                        <br /> 
                        \( \text{Average Price Per Room} = \frac{\text{Sum of (House Price/Number of Rooms)}}{\text{Total Number of Properties}} \)
                        <br /> 
                        After obtaining this normalized value for each property, we then computed the average across all properties in various suburbs. This method allows for a more equitable comparison across Melbourne's diverse housing market.

                            In Melbourne, the rental market is as dynamic as it is challenging for tenants. Known for its vibrant culture and booming job market, the city has seen a steady increase in rent prices over recent years.

                            While some suburbs offer relatively affordable options, prime locations in the city centre and coastal areas often come with exorbitant rental costs. In our data visualization, we've included a comprehensive breakdown of average rent prices by suburb to provide a clearer picture of what you can expect to pay. These figures reveal a pressing need for policy intervention to address housing affordability, especially as many residents already allocate a significant portion of their income towards rent.

                    The number of households with 1 or 2 people have increased over the years while the others remained unchanged or decreased. This could hint at the fact that an averge person is starting to own more houses but overall families still live together. If this is the case it could be a contributing factor to the housing crisis as people are starting to treat houses as investment properties.

                        The employment landscape in Melbourne has undergone significant changes over the years from 2000 to 2023, according to the dataset provided. Here's a detailed summary that covers two important aspects: gender-specific employment and employment type.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the year 2000, full-time employees counted 1584.6, and part-time were 542.9. Over the years, full-time employment has generally been more prevalent. However, part-time employment also saw an increase but at a less consistent pace. By 2023, full-time employment rose dramatically to 2475.4, while part-time positions reached 1036.5. This indicates a stronger growth in full-time employment, about 56.2% growth from 2000 to 2023 compared to a 91% growth in part-time employment during the same period.

                    There has always been more males than females in the workforce. Good news is the employment rate for both are increasingly steadily. Initially, in the year 2000, males held 1212.7 jobs compared to females, who held 954.4 jobs. Over the course of nearly a quarter-century, both categories saw increases, but the rate at which females entered the workforce was striking. By 2023, males held 1875 jobs, while females were not far behind at 1686.1. The gap between male and female employment has been closing steadily, indicating a more gender-balanced workforce. It's worth noting that the growth in female employment rates outpaces that of males, especially in the latter years. For instance, while male employment grew by approximately 54.7% from 2000 to 2023, female employment grew by about 76.6% during the same period.

                    The employment rate in Melbourne has been on an upward trajectory, largely due to a booming tech industry and a surge in construction and infrastructure projects. Government initiatives to attract global businesses have also contributed to job creation, making the city an increasingly attractive hub for both employers and job-seekers.

                    The data provided showcases the fluctuation in unemployment rates in Melbourne from the year 2000 to 2023. In 2000, the unemployment rate started at a relatively high 6.6%, but showed a generally decreasing trend for the first decade, reaching a low of 4.5% in 2008. This decline was interrupted by spikes in 2002 and 2009, presumably due to economic conditions at the time.

                        <h1>Rent vs. Price in Melbourne</h1>
                        The parallel coordinate diagram showcases the relationship between home prices and rent prices in different Melbourne suburbs. Each line represents a suburb, and where these lines position between the home and rent axes indicates the costs for that area. Some suburbs, like Inner Melbourne, have higher costs for both buying and renting, while others, like Bendigo, show a more balanced pricing. This chart offers a quick comparison of housing costs across Melbourne, making it easier to understand the financial landscape of each suburb.

                        <h1>Melbourne is no Longer the Most Liveable City</h1>
                        In recent years, Melbourne has seen a decline in its rank as the "most liveable city," a title it once proudly held. While the city continues to score high in areas such as healthcare, education, and culture, it has faced challenges that impact its liveability.
                        <br /><br />
                        Issues such as rising cost of living, urban congestion, and environmental concerns have played a role in its lowered ranking. Additionally, the global COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the metrics of liveability, placing a greater emphasis on healthcare infrastructure and crisis management, areas where other cities have outperformed Melbourne. As a result, cities like Vienna and Vancouver have overtaken Melbourne in the rankings.
